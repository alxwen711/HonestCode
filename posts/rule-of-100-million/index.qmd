Many problems in competitive programming...

## A Quick Review of Big-O Notation

- Add formula here

- easier explanation?

## 100 Million Operations Per Second

- state rule 100 million -> 1 second

- roughly a factor of 3 up and down for optimistic/pragmatic estimates

- Python from experience roughly divide by 3

- insert table of n values here with basic runtime examples
- bolded cases are the most common

## Exceptions Where Slowest Allowed != Fastest Possible

### Div 2A Type Problems

- tend to have very small n, but obviously not O(n^4) or something like that

### $O(n^3)$ Estimates and Longer

- These tend to be more common on harder problems, usually

- round 1073 2B example/incident, technically O(n^4) is possible
